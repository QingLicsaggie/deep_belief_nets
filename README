Deep Belief Nets
================

A C++ implementation of the Deep Belief Net training algorithm
described in [1], with more detail available in [2]. There's also a
Google tech talk covering the application [3].

I also need to watch [4] for an update at some point :-)

You'll need to grab the MNIST digit data from [5] and gunzip the files
in a directory called 'data' at the project root.
